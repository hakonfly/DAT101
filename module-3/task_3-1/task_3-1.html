    Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?
    <p>
      When wakeUpTime is not 7, the condition (wakeUpTime === 7) is false, so the if-block does not run. When wakeUpTime is exactly 7, the condition is true and the message about taking the bus is printed.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Same as question #1. However the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?
    <p>
      With if/else there is always an outcome. If wakeUpTime is 7, the "bus" branch runs. Otherwise (any other value), the "car" branch runs.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?
    <p>
      With if / else if / else: exactly 7 gives the bus, exactly 8 gives the train. If wakeUpTime is less than 7 or greater than 8, neither condition matches, so it falls to the else-case (car).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?
    <p>
      In part 4, if the code is written as "if number &lt; 0 then Negative else Positive", the value 0 goes to the else-branch and is treated as Positive. Mathematically, 0 is neither positive nor negative, which is why part 5 adds a separate check for Zero.
