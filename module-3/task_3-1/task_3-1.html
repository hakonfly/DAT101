      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When wakeUpTime is not 7, the condition is false, so the code inside the if-block does not run (no bus message is printed). When wakeUpTime is exactly 7, the condition is true and the bus message is printed.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>With if/else, you always get an outcome. If wakeUpTime is exactly 7, the "bus" branch runs. Otherwise (any other value), the "car" branch runs.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>This uses if / else if / else. Exactly 7 gives the bus, exactly 8 gives the train. If wakeUpTime is less than 7 or greater than 8 (or any other value), it falls through to the else-branch (car).With if/else, you always get an outcome. If wakeUpTime is exactly 7, the "bus" branch runs. Otherwise (any other value), the "car" branch runs.th you answer]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
